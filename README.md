# CensusDataAnalysis

Project Summary:
In this project, we analyse a mock Census Dataset of over 9400 records. 
The aim is to find useful trends and insights in the dataset and make recommendations to the government on the best place to channel developmental efforts. 
We begin by carrying out various data cleaning and preprocessing steps, then we go ahead to analyse the data using matplotlib and seaborn to create rich visualisations.
